    <hr class="horizontal-separator">
    <p class="text-padding">This self-assessment tool was developed specifically for small organisations. However, it is
        beneficial for small to medium-sized organisations in the private, public and third sectors.<br><br>

        Good information management makes good business sense for an organisation. It improves an organisation's
        reputation, increases customer and employee confidence and saves time and money by ensuring that personal
        information is accurate, relevant and secure. However, insufficient compliance with GDPR can result in heavy
        fines for the company on the one hand. On the other hand, it can be accompanied by a loss of reputation and
        associated financial losses.<br><br>

        With our checklists, you can review your compliance with data protection laws and determine what steps you need
        to take to ensure data is kept in compliance with the law. After completing each checklist, short feedback is
        available to suggest practical actions to improve your data protection compliance. Please note that the results
        of the checklists are not legally binding and are only intended to assist you.<br><br>

        The following questions can indicate the relevance of the guidelines to determine whether GDPR applies to your
        business at all. In addition, you can continue with the <a href="templates/pre-checklist.html" target="_blank">Pre-Checklist</a>
        or various other checklists in the
        <a href="templates/overview-assessments.html" target="_blank">Assessments section</a> for a more in-depth
        assessment. Finally, the <a href="templates/overview-results.html" target="_blank">Overview /
            Results</a> page gives an overview of the checklists that have already been completed and allows you to
        print out the results for documentation purposes.

        Good information management makes good business sense for a company. It will improve the reputation of an
        organisation, increase customer and employee confidence and save time and money by ensuring that personal
        information is accurate, relevant and secure.
        <br><br>
        With our checklists, you can check your compliance with data protection laws and find out what steps you
        need to take to ensure you keep data compliant with the law. Upon completion of each checklist, a short
        feedback is available for you to suggest practical actions you can take to improve your data protection
        compliance.

    <h2>Controllers and Processors Checklist</h2>
    <p class="text-padding">First of all you should determine whether your organisation has the role of a data controller,
      a data processor or both. This clarification is important because the scope of requirements to achieve GDPR
      compliance is different for the two roles.
      <h3>Data Controllers Role</h3>
      The data controller is the person or organisation who determines the purpose, procedure and scope of data usage and processing.
      Data controllers hold the responsibility for protecting the privacy and rights of a data subject. This means that the data controller
      holds the control over the data. The data controller is also responsible for obtaining and managing tasks like obtaining the consent
      for data processing.
      <br><br>

      <h3>Data Processors Role</h3>
      The data processor processes data on behalf of the data controller. A data processor does neither own nor control the data processed.
      This means that the data processor is not able to change the purpose and means in which the data is used. The are bound to the instructions
      given by the data controller. In this context, data processing includes also trivial tasks such as data storing on a third party's servers.

      <h3>Still unsure about your role?</h3>
      The tasks, responsibilities and many other topics regarding data controller and data processor are described in more detail in
      <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-4/" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a> of GDPR. A good staring point are
      <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-24-gdpr/" target="_blank">Article 24</a> and
      <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/" target="_blank">Article 28</a>.

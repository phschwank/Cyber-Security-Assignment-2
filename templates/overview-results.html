                remember that the Lawful Basis is the essential basis for the Guidelines. It is of utmost importance
                that you clearly define your Lawful Basis for data processing and communicate it to clients accordingly.
                We strongly advise you to go through the unimplemented items on the checklist and take appropriate
                actions.</p>

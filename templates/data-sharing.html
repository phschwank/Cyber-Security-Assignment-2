                step, it is advisable to define guidelines that determine which lawful basis applies and which data is
                shared with whom. It is always advisable to keep data sharing to a minimum.

            <p class="silver-text" id="silver-text">Congratulations, your organisation meets the
                requirements for data sharing and subject access at a good level. Nevertheless, we recommend that you go
                through the open or unimplemented points of the checklist as soon as possible and implement appropriate
                measures. In a further step, it is advisable to define guidelines that determine which lawful basis

            <p class="bronze-text" id="bronze-text">Your organisation meets the requirements for data
                sharing and subject access at a satisfactory level. We strongly recommend that you go through the open
                or unimplemented items on the checklist as soon as possible and implement appropriate measures. As a
                further step, it is advisable to define policies that specify which lawful basis applies and which data
                is shared and with whom. Note that data sharing always poses a certain risk to the rights and freedoms
                of the data subject. It is therefore advisable to keep data sharing to a minimum.

            <p class="warning-text" id="warning-text">Unfortunately, it seems that the level of data
                sharing and subject access is not yet sufficient in terms of GDPR compliance. We therefore strongly
                recommend that you immediately go through the open or unimplemented items on the checklist and take
                appropriate action. As a further step, it is advisable to define policies that specify which lawful
                basis applies, which data is shared with whom and whether you effectively have the right to share.
                Finally, note that data sharing always poses a certain risk to the rights and freedoms of the data
                subject. In particular, cross-border transfers of data, especially with countries outside the EU/EEA,
                pose an increased risk for the data subject. It is therefore advisable to always keep data sharing to a
                minimum.

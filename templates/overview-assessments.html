    <p class="text-padding">Below you can find the checklists provided to evaluate the state of GDPR compliance in your
        organisation. Each checklist consists of several questions and a short explanation about the content of this
        question.
        Furthermore, also weblinks to additional information, resources and the relevant GDPR articles are provided.<br><br>
        If you don't know where you should start or which checklists are relevant to your organisation, we recommend you
        to start
        with the pre-checklist. This checklist will help you to evaluate the most important checklists for your
        organisation.
        However, if you already know what is important and relevant to you, feel free to progress on your own. All
        checklists
        are independent from each other.</p>

    <h2>Pre-Checklist</h2>
    <p class="text-padding"> The following checklist assists you to quickly and easily find out how well you comply with
        data protection law to keep people's personal data secure. It outlines the significant points and brings you
        awareness about the rules. Non-compliance with GDPR rules may cause penalties and costs.<br><br> More info about

    <h2>Controllers and Processors Checklist</h2>
    <p class="text-padding">First of all you should determine whether your organisation has the role of a data
        controller, a data processor or both. This clarification is important because the scope of requirements to
        achieve GDPR compliance is different for the two roles.
    <h3>Data Controllers Role</h3>
    The data controller is the person or organisation who determines the purpose, procedure and scope of data usage and
    processing. Data controllers hold the responsibility for protecting the privacy and rights of a data subject. This
    means that the data controller holds the control over the data. The data controller is also responsible for
    obtaining and managing tasks like obtaining the consent for data processing.
    <br><br>
    <a href="controllers-checklist.html" class="checklist-button">Controllers Checklist</a>
    <h3>Data Processors Role</h3>
    The data processor processes data on behalf of the data controller. A data processor does neither own nor control
    the data processed. This means that the data processor is not able to change the purpose and means in which the data
    is used. The are bound to the instructions given by the data controller. In this context, data processing includes
    also trivial tasks such as data storing on a third party's servers.
    <br><br>
    <a href="processors-checklist.html" class="checklist-button">Processors Checklist</a>
    <h3>Still unsure about your role?</h3>
    The tasks, responsibilities and many other topics regarding data controller and data processor are described in more
    detail in
    <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-4/" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a> of GDPR. A good staring point are
    <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-24-gdpr/" target="_blank">Article 24</a> and
    <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/" target="_blank">Article 28</a>.

    <h2>Information Security Checklist</h2>
    <p class="text-padding">
        To be compliant with the GDPR guidelines, it is necessary that the existing and used IT infrastructure is secure
        and maintained. For this, it is important that you comply with data protection in the specific areas of
        information and cyber security policies and risks, mobile and home working, removable media, access controls and
        malware protection.
        <br><br>
        The security controls listed <a
            href="https://cipher.com/blog/how-does-information-security-support-the-eu-gdpr/"
            target="_blank">here</a> show which information security best practices are required to support
        compliance with the EU GDPR and to manage the data of EU individuals in accordance with the GDPR.

    <h2>Data Sharing and Subject Access Checklist</h2>
    <p class="text-padding">
        To be compliant with GDPR guidelines, it is necessary to have appropriate data sharing and subject access
        policies in place. In particular, it is of great importance that you yourself, but also your clients, are clear
        about the intentions of data sharing. Your clients have a right to know how their data is being used, i.e. what
        data is being collected, stored, processed and with whom it is being shared. The checklist is designed to help
        you assess your data sharing policies and agreements and monitor compliance.
        <br><br>
        Key points of data sharing are described in this <a href="https://gdpr.eu/data-sharing-bounty-fine/"
                                                            target="_blank">use case</a>. <a
            href="https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-3/" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a> of the GDPR policy also provides
        information on the rights of the data subject and, in the case of international data transfer, <a
            href="https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-5/" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a> should also be consulted.

    <h2>Record Management Checklist</h2>
    <p class="text-padding">
        In order to be compliant with GDPR guidelines, it is necessary to have appropriate records management policies
        in
        place. In particular, this is of great importance in order to ensure correct data access by data subjects and
        correct handling of the retention period of the respective data. The checklist is designed to help you assess
        your records management procedures and risks to peopleâ€™s personal information. Includes record creation, storage
        and disposal, access, tracking and off-site storage.
        <br><br>
        However, in certain circumstances, it is not mandatory to maintain records of processing. Further information on
        this as well as general information on records management under GDPR can be found <a

    <h2>Lawful Basis Checklist</h2>
    <p class="text-padding"> You are only allowed to collect, store and process data if you have a lawful basis to do
        that. This reason makes
        the lawful basis to one of the most important topics in GDPR. GDPR knows the following six lawful bases:
        <br><br>
    <ul class="specification-list-level-one">
        <li>Consent</li>
        <li>Performance of a Contract</li>
        <li>Legitimate Interest</li>
        <li>Vital Interest</li>
        <li>Legal Requirement</li>
        <li>Public Interest</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    Choosing the correct and appropriate lawful basis is of utmost importance because it cannot be changed afterwards.
    However, this checklist
    will support you in choosing the correct lawful basis for your organisation. If you need more information about it,
    you can find some
